# rudder-pedals

This is an ongoing project where I'm building rudder pedals for use in flight-sims from scratch.
The aim is to have rudder pedals with working brakes, with the pedals themselves modelled after the venerable F14 Tomcat pedals.
The mechanism is made from scratch by yours truly, with inspiration from various sources.

The goal is to make a pair of pedals that are:
* Easy to make (Requiring few tools, and a small 3D printer)
* Reasonably cheap
* Accurate and well functioning
* Free to download

Status as of writing:
The pedals are working and I'm starting to use them while "flying". 
I still have to fix some small details, like the box for the bodnar control board.
I've decided to postpone work on the full pedals with brake mechanism until I've I've finished all the details and the documentation.
